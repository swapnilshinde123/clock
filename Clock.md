## Release 1:
Using your newfound knowledge of CSS Animations, build a clock using entirely HTML and CSS! Here's an example:

![alt text](images/clock.gif)

There are a couple of things to note. 
-First, the clock image above runs at 10x the speed of an actual clock; your clock should move at a normal rate. 
-Second, you know enough CSS now to make your clock much nicer looking than this one!

(Hint: you may need to look into the `transform-origin` property when building your animation. Good luck.)
